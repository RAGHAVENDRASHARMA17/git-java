What is Error Handling :

What is error ?

Any type of bug in the program is called as error. there are following types of errors
  1. compile time error - error which occurs while we compile the program. easiest to find
	a. syntax error - error in writing syntax of the program. for example: no semicolon, small letter at the place of capital letter etc.
	b. semantic error - error in writing rule of the statement for example: a + b=c

  2. runtime error - it occurs while we run the program. for example: divide by zero error , array index out of bound error etc etc. typical to find
	
  3. logical error - error in the logic of program. for example: we have used +(addition) at the place of - (subtraction). hardest to find.

1.) Whenever a programmer develops a program, he will remove all compile time and logical errors but runtime error depends on various other factors that why it is not possible to remove all runtime  
    errors so the program have to handle these errors in the program. and this is called error handling / exception handling.

2.) In java error handling is done with the  help of 
     a) try - in this block of the program we write all of the statements that are prone to error
     b) catch - in this block of program we write error handling code.
